4.04	4.05	[0] i
4.08	4.16	[0] don
4.18	4.2	[0] t
4.24	4.32	[0] know
4.62	4.7	[1] that
4.8	4.96	[1] seems
5.01	5.09	[1] like
5.16	5.22	[1] a
5.26	5.38	[1] lot
7.32	7.34	[0] i
7.4	7.5	[0] mean
7.62	7.63	[1] i
7.7	7.8	[1] think
7.85	7.92	[1] you
7.95	8.03	[1] know
8.11	8.16	[1] it
8.22	8.34	[1] would
8.38	8.43	[1] be
8.48	8.58	[1] nice
8.61	8.92	[1] especially
9.0	9.08	[1] like
9.14	9.19	[1] you
9.22	9.3	[1] know
9.35	9.46	[1] when
9.51	9.66	[1] people
9.74	9.8	[1] are
10.03	10.18	[1] kids

10.46	10.5	[0] in
10.59	10.82	[0] college
10.93	11.01	[0] they
11.09	11.24	[0] should
11.3	11.34	[0] do
11.48	11.58	[1] some
11.69	11.88	[1] public
12.01	12.27	[1] service
13.43	13.5	[0] um
15.24	15.35	[0] part
15.43	15.48	[0] of
15.62	15.64	[0] a
15.76	15.87	[0] part
15.93	15.97	[0] of
16.07	16.11	[0] it
16.18	16.31	[0] though
17.43	17.45	[0] i
17.51	17.69	[0] agree
17.75	17.84	[0] with
17.89	17.95	[0] you
18.11	18.41	[0] sometimes
18.51	18.55	[0] it
18.66	18.81	[0] sounds
18.93	19.01	[0] like
19.09	19.13	[0] a
19.19	19.31	[0] lot
19.45	19.53	[0] but
20.16	20.19	[0] i
20.29	20.41	[0] think
20.59	20.73	[0] less
20.81	20.91	[0] than
21.03	21.05	[0] a
21.13	21.23	[0] year
22.37	22.45	[0] they
22.55	22.68	[0] don't
22.75	22.87	[0] learn
22.97	23.19	[0] enough
24.71	24.75	[0] i
24.82	24.93	[0] think
25.01	25.07	[0] you
25.19	25.29	[0] just
25.34	25.51	[0] about
25.63	25.71	[0] have

29.57	29.63	[0] and
29.77	30.03	[0] ideal
30.16	30.57	[0] conditions
32.83	32.89	[0] to
33.03	33.15	[0] learn
33.28	33.37	[0] some
33.43	33.47	[0] of
33.53	33.61	[0] the
33.75	33.79	[0] uh
34.39	34.46	[0] you
34.5	34.57	[0] know
34.68	34.89	[0] lessons
34.97	35.06	[0] that
35.18	35.37	[0] really
35.43	35.53	[0] need
35.6	35.65	[0] to
35.71	35.75	[0] be
35.85	36.01	[0] learned
37.0	37.1	[0] may
37.29	37.37	[0] may
37.5	37.51	[0] i
37.65	37.78	[0] have
37.87	37.93	[0] how

41.24	41.32	[0] have
41.35	41.47	[0] been
41.53	41.87	[0] affected

82.91	82.97	[0] and
83.05	83.11	[0] i
83.18	83.3	[0] think
83.36	83.41	[0] it
83.47	83.6	[0] would
83.69	83.96	[0] broaden
84.02	84.1	[0] the
84.32	84.39	[0] the
84.63	85.08	[0] horizon
86.19	86.24	[0] of
86.38	86.44	[0] the

87.24	87.46	[0] really
88.66	88.74	[0] the
88.8	88.88	[0] way
88.97	89.03	[0] the
89.11	89.22	[0] rest
89.3	89.33	[0] of
89.39	89.46	[0] the
89.53	89.68	[0] world
90.08	90.13	[0] the
90.19	90.33	[0] rest
90.41	90.46	[0] of
90.52	90.58	[0] the
90.66	90.88	[0] country
91.05	91.22	[0] lives
92.74	92.77	[1] it
92.88	93.16	[1] certainly
93.24	93.36	[1] would
93.82	93.89	[1] but
96.11	96.38	[0] appro
97.47	97.68	[0] getting
97.75	97.77	[0] a
97.89	98.16	[0] feeling
98.27	98.33	[0] for
98.5	98.89	[0] humanity
99.0	99.25	[0] itself
99.39	99.44	[1] i
