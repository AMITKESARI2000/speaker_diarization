[00:01.84 - 00:02.09] speaker_0: a year
[00:02.40 - 00:03.61] speaker_1: a year or two in public service
[00:04.04 - 00:04.32] speaker_0: i don t know
[00:04.62 - 00:05.38] speaker_1: that seems like a lot
[00:07.32 - 00:07.50] speaker_0: i mean
[00:07.62 - 00:10.38] speaker_1: i think you know it would be nice especially like you know when people are kids go
[00:10.46 - 00:11.34] speaker_0: in college they should do
[00:11.48 - 00:12.27] speaker_1: some public service
[00:13.43 - 00:38.46] speaker_0: um part of a part of it though i agree with you sometimes it sounds like a lot but i think less than a year they don't learn enough i think you just about have to be away from home for a full year under left and ideal conditions to learn some of the uh you know lessons that really need to be learned may may i have how old you are
[00:38.83 - 00:39.35] speaker_1: i'm twenty six
[00:39.61 - 00:52.85] speaker_0: twenty six you're young enough so you might have been affected so yeah i really i really feel that um if every kid had to be away from home boy when they got back they certainly would have a different
[00:53.03 - 00:58.97] speaker_1: uh that's true verica some pupil spend far too much time in the same thing
[00:59.06 - 01:00.28] speaker_0: and that and not really you know
[01:00.43 - 01:01.32] speaker_1: seeing any other part of
[01:01.38 - 01:31.22] speaker_0: the world yeah and you know mom and dad and home look a lot better oh yeah it s a pentiful way and i don't mean even in a foreign country you know i mean if you were just away from home for a year i know without the comfort that that mom and dad provide if i mean if you're lucky enough to have both but but um yeah i i think it would be wonderful and i think it would broaden the the horizon of the kids for really the way the rest of the world the rest of the country lives
[01:32.74 - 01:33.89] speaker_1: it certainly would but
[01:36.11 - 01:39.25] speaker_0: appro getting a feeling for humanity itself
[01:39.39 - 01:40.69] speaker_1: i think yeah
[01:41.97 - 01:43.24] speaker_0: have you been in arles at all
[01:43.77 - 01:49.05] speaker_1: no i haven't i just i just survived los angeles i

[01:58.83 - 01:59.02] speaker_0: you know
[01:59.10 - 02:00.39] speaker_1: i heard gunfire it's the first
[02:00.44 - 02:00.88] speaker_0: time i felt
[02:01.02 - 02:01.27] speaker_1: my life
[02:01.41 - 02:02.63] speaker_0: was you know a little
[02:02.66 - 02:03.16] speaker_1: bit threatened
[02:04.44 - 02:12.80] speaker_0: so so i am so distressed with the media the the the people in the helicopter that did not land and see that guy from being killed
[02:13.50 - 02:17.50] speaker_1: i know but they they never they never interfere
[02:17.70 - 02:21.58] speaker_0: he just well i mean if it's not like we're fighting to war some place else
[02:22.16 - 02:22.38] speaker_1: i know
[02:24.48 - 02:30.70] speaker_0: this is the bad guys were killing us i'm sorry you know i just can't believe it they didn't go down there and stop that from happening
[02:31.60 - 02:33.96] speaker_1: and it seems like you know i base basic decency
[02:34.08 - 02:38.98] speaker_0: would you know require them to do it but i would think so but uh are you married
[02:39.28 - 02:39.58] speaker_1: no not
[02:39.98 - 02:42.40] speaker_0: so you don't have anybody yet that you have to feel that you have
[02:42.42 - 02:43.18] speaker_1: to protect race
[02:44.08 - 03:04.50] speaker_0: but um well let's think of this for a moment if i e had been required some time around the age of twenty to spend a year some place doing something what what sort of things might you feel would be uh the type of things that would do good for the country i don't know i think it a lot
[03:04.56 - 03:06.36] speaker_1: of it's just you know see how other people
[03:06.46 - 03:07.22] speaker_0: live i mean you know
[03:07.32 - 03:08.34] speaker_1: i i tend to
[03:08.38 - 03:08.82] speaker_0: be you know i
[03:09.02 - 03:12.86] speaker_1: in my own circles of friends and we're all pretty much
[03:12.96 - 03:14.90] speaker_0: the same up in the middle class probably
[03:16.22 - 03:16.48] speaker_1: probably
[03:16.94 - 03:17.62] speaker_0: in higher than that
[03:18.28 - 03:19.36] speaker_1: no oven california
[03:19.54 - 03:19.84] speaker_0: so what
[03:21.40 - 03:23.26] speaker_1: it's not really upper middle class here is the problem
[03:24.58 - 03:38.86] speaker_0: yeah that's true um do you feel that a well i i personally feel about six weeks of basic training ought to be the a mandatory part of this year do you have any feelings about that but
[03:38.98 - 03:39.60] speaker_1: what about the people
[03:39.62 - 03:41.20] speaker_0: who don't make it i mean what what do you
[03:41.48 - 03:41.86] speaker_1: do with them
[03:43.34 - 04:04.92] speaker_0: well you okay you make it as rigorous as you can be for everybody you know and if they just can't make it uh it's like other things you use less and not so that they can make it you try to demand that much of them but if they can't make it and and there are people you know who who are not were not as healthy and so on and so forth but they can find other things for them
[04:04.98 - 04:06.14] speaker_1: to do all service to the
[04:06.30 - 04:19.13] speaker_0: this plan to do i mean if it's like in high school or junior i or wherever that certain people are excused from going to gym class or whatever but in the mean almost everybody has to do it
[04:22.77 - 04:24.98] speaker_1: yeah i can relate to that
[04:26.57 - 04:27.05] speaker_0: i do think
[04:27.15 - 04:27.33] speaker_1: you know
[04:27.45 - 04:28.25] speaker_0: people people need to
[04:28.75 - 04:33.77] speaker_1: to meet other types of people well i just you know living living in different ways than they do
[04:35.33 - 04:47.54] speaker_0: and and and college doesn't really do it no no not at all yeah first of all not everybody gets a chance to go to college but in college i mean you're still among basically the same class of people that you've grown up with
[04:47.77 - 04:47.92] speaker_1: real
[04:48.92 - 04:58.33] speaker_0: so you don't get to see how the other half lives or the other two thirds or however many there are now um i i am old enough i'm over fifty
